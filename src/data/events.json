This “death spiral” wiped out around $45 billion in market capitalization and severely shook confidence across the broader crypto market. The design relied on an unstable mint-and-burn arbitrage mechanism rather than traditional collateral, making it especially fragile once large holders began selling. The collapse led to bankruptcies, investor losses worldwide, and intense scrutiny by regulators; Terraform Labs ultimately filed for bankruptcy and founder Do Kwon has since been convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison for fraud tied to the crash.",

    "summary": "OlympusDAO popularized the “(3,3)” meme to describe a gamified incentive structure where all participants are rewarded for staking and cooperating rather than selling. The (3,3) meme became one of the most famous Crypto Twitter in-jokes of the DeFi era, showing up in thousands of replies and bios as a shorthand for protocol loyalty & staking behavior. It summed DeFi yields into a simple “game” outcome that traders could laugh about long after Olympus peaked.",

The compromised accounts posted a Bitcoin scam promising to double any BTC sent, briefly netting the attackers over $100k and sending Crypto Twitter into chaos. Twitter responded by locking many verified accounts from tweeting, underscoring how centralized “trusted access” can become a single point of failure.",

Using sophisticated social engineering, they impersonated Google and Gemini support to reset the victim's 2FA and drain the wallet. ZachXBT's investigation uncovered a leaked celebration video showing attackers' real-time reactions, Instagram posts of luxury spending including pink car gifts, and device fingerprints linking them to Mark Cuban's June 2024 compromise. FBI raids in Miami and LA on September 18, 2024 led to multiple arrests. A fourth suspect, British national Danish Zulfiqar, was reportedly arrested in Dubai in December 2024 with $18.5M seized. Funds were rapidly laundered across 15+ exchanges.",
